/**
 * Simple class to track interactions with disk and cache memory, thereby
 * measuring the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of # of times the code
 * writes/reads to the disk and hits the cached memory, which prevent expensive
 * read/write operations. Also capable of writing that data to a file along with
 * the execution time of any task with the System.currentTimeMillis() method.
